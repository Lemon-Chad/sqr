# SQR

You are a square. You kill squares. No square left alive.

# How to Play

Don't die.

You have three bars upon starting a game, the bottom is your stamina bar, the middle is your
health bar, and the top is your blood bar. 

## Stamina

When you perform actions like dashing and meeleeing,
you use up stamina. You cannot regain stamina while running.

## Health

When you get hit, you lose health. Simple.

You cannot regenerate your health. The only way to regain health is through the **Siphon** ability
for your **Blood Meter**.

## Blood Bar

When you kill enemies, your blood bar gets a little fuller. Once your blood bar reaches its
maximum value, you can press `F` to choose a special ability to temporarily activate.

## Psychosis

The more you kill, the more deranged you become. You can see a killstreak in the top left corner.
The higher your killstreak, the more your insanity level grows. When your insanity level grows
your character becomes shakier and less precise. Your accuracy drops heavily and your screen
will shake more violently. To avoid psychosis, take frequent breaks from murder sprees and wait
for your character to shake less violently while dodging the enemies.
